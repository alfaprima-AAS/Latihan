=======================

hey, did you know michael jackson used to work on sonic 3 for a long while? he was a fan of the sonic franchise around that time (early 1990's) and he was happy to contribute to the soundtrack.
though, near the release of sonic 3 (1993), he got into a few allegations that stained his public view on the public and which subsequently prompted sega to wipe his name (and his team) from the credits.
though, despite all of this, his contributions on the soundtrack stays regardless, mostly because it was way too late into development to change things.
proof of this is Carnival Night Zone, Ice Cap Zone, Launch Base Zone, and the Credits theme, to name a few.
